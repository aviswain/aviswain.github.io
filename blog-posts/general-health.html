        <h2 id="subheading">Working Out</h2>
        <p>Currently I am optimizing for endurance, hypertrophy, and flexibility. I never got impressed by living heavy weights and honestly I'm quite scared of severely injuring myself. Despite
          that, I try to do compound movements at least once a week (Bench, Squat, Deadlift, and Bent-over Rows). Here is 
          my current training split...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>D1: Quad-Dominant Legs</li>
          <li>D2: Chest</li>
          <li>D3: Back and Biceps</li>
          <li>D4: Abs and Lower Back</li>
          <li>D5: Quads</li>
          <li>D6: Hams and little bit of Back</li>
          <li>D7: Chest</li>
          <li>D8: Abs and Lower Back</li>
          <li>repeat...</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If I ever get a bad night of sleep, I do a 20-90 min Zone-2 cardio session instead of working out that day. 
          I try to run outside because it's the easiest for me to get into 'Zone-2' quickly (I just measure Z2 as a pace where
          it's not enjoyable to keep a conversation at). But if I can't do that because of the weather, I use a stationary bike
          and do a longer session for around 60-90 mins since it takes me longer to get into Z2. My running sessions are normally around
          20-45 mins.
        </p>
        <p>       
          Most times I prefer lifting weights over cardio, but I also hate going to the gym when I'm not in the mood. The gym is a nice 
          break for me in the middle of the day (I normally workout 1-2 hours after breakfast), and I don't want to ruin it by
          dragging myself to do it on the days I get no sleep.
        <p>
          As per flexibility, I really should be working more on it. As of now, I just stretch and foam roll whenever I feel like it.
        </p>
        
        <h2 id="subheading">Eating</h2>

        <p>I have some general guidelines I follow when it comes to my nutrition. They have worked well for me and I don't see myself
          changing them drastically in the future...
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>I eat meals made at home as much as possible. I also avoid eating packaged foods and try to <mark>stick to whole foods</mark>. I love freshly made food!</li>
          <li>I <mark>keep things balanced</mark>. Everyday I get some fruits, vegetables, carbs, fats, protein in. I don't count calories because that
            takes the fun out of it for me
          </li>
          <li>I <mark>stay traditional</mark>. I mostly eat traditional dishes that have been a part of my family for many generations.
            If you think about it, your body is basically a product of natural selection across thousands of years. It just makes more
            sense to eat what your ancestors ate instead of anything else.
          </li>
          <li>I <mark>don't eat immediately after waking up or immediately before going to sleep</mark>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the overall mindset behind my nutritional choices. But here's some more details...</p>
        <p>Pre-Breakfast</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Foods: Water (18 ounces minimum)</li>
          <li>Time: 7:00 AM</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Breakfast:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Foods: Oatmeal, Banana, Berries, Nuts, Honey, Potatoes, Eggs, Kefir/Yogurt, Green Tea, Bread (rarely)</li>
          <li>Time: Around 10:00 AM.</li>
          <li>Usually somewhat heavy as its the meal before I workout. I focus on eating enough carbs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lunch:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Foods: Rice, Vegetables, Beans, Lentils, Chicken</li>
          <li>Time: Around 1:00 - 2:00 PM</li>
          <li>Most of the time this is my lightest meal. I eat it right after I workout. I eat enough to just get me by until dinner.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Dinner:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Foods: Rice, Vegetables, Beans, Lentils, Meat</li>
          <li>Time: 7:00 - 8:00 PM. I aim for 2 hours before sleeping.</li>
          <li>This is usually my heaviest meal. I like feeling full at the end of the day as it keeps me relaxed before sleep.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the typical routine for me. Every now and then I do get cravings for something savory or sugary. On those days
          I go out to eat with family and friends. I love the usual things - ice cream, burgers, pies, cake, pizza, cookies, etc. 
          Unfortunately, when I choose eat desserts, I have the 'go big or go home' mindset. It's just how I'm wired. I do find 
          that I get terrible sleep on those days and it messes up my next day, so I don't do it a lot (I end up relearning this
          lesson every 3 weeks or so).
